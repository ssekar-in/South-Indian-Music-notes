# South-Indian-Music-notes
The code calculates cent values for the notes of South Indian Music based on known ratios of notes.
Further another code calculates the notes from the fifths and fourths and calculates the cent values as below:
Microtones calculation in South Indian carnatic music:
Calculation procedure:This is based on the book by Prof P Sambamoorthy, South Indian Music, Book:IV, Fourth edition, 1975, Chapter V on 22 srutis.
The calculation is based on perfect 5ths( ratio 3/2) and perfect 4ths ( ratio 4/3). The srutis are said to be derived from calculation fifth of fifth of fifth .. 3/2 x 3/2 x 3/2 ..reduced to octave one and fourth of fourth of fourth.. reduced to octave one.
The number of cycles taken is 11 for the fifths. As perfect fifth is 701.955 cents ( 1200 x log base2 (3/2)), the 11th cycle yields 7721.5 cents, which reduces to 7721.5 - 6 x 1200 = 521.5 cents in the first octave. In other words, upto 7th octave the calculation is proceeded.¶
Similarly fourth of fourth of fourth .. 4/3 x 4/3 x 4/3.. In this case the number of cycles considered is ten. As perfect fourth is 498.045 cents ( 1200 logbase2(4/3)), the 10th cycles yields 4980.5 cents, which is in the fifth octave.
Once the above srutis that is, note value in cents are calculated, they are arranged in ascending order to get the 22 srutis including microtones.
It is also observed that when calculation up to 5 cycles for fifths and 6 cycles for fourths are only considered, that is only up to third octave for both fifths and fourths, the semitones are got.
When the calculated notes are arranged in ascending order, we get,
90, 114, 180, 204, 294, 318, 408, 498, 522, 588, 612, 678, 702, 792, 816, 882, 906, 996, 1020, 1086 and 1110.
When only frequencies up to 3rd octave is considered, as described in the procedure above, the notes are 90, 204, 294, 408, 498, 588, 702, 792, 906, 996 and 1110 which are unequal semitones which are 90 cents or 114 cents apart.¶
The microtones are 24 cents away from the semitones. Thus we can consider 12 semitones as 2 fixed tones (Sa and Pa) and 10 pairs as below:
Sa= 0, R1 = 90/114, R2(G1) = 180/204, R3(G2)= 294/318, G3=384/408, M1= 498/522, M2= 588/612, Pa= 702( fixed), D1=792/816, D2(N1)= 882/906, D3(N2)= 996/1020 and N3 1086/1110.
It is noted that Purna sruti(Pythagorean limma 256/243) is 90 cents apart. However pramana sruti is 24 cents apart as per above calculations. Hence nyuna sruti is 66 cents. However in the reference book above pramana sruti is given as 81/80 = 1.0125, while the ratio got in the calculation is 743/733= 1.0136. Thus the calculation gives eka sruti values of pramana sruti = 24 cents, nyuna sruti = 66 and purna sruti=90 ( no cahange), while the reference book gives the corresponding values as 22, 70 and 90. 
Further it can be observed that the fifths are the higher pitch in each semitone pair and the fourths are lower of the pair. The difference is 24 cents. The fifths are higher than equi tempered tones of 100, 200 etc and the fourths are lower than the equi tempered scale.
It is noted that Suddha madhyama ( 498 cents) is the perfect fourth and Prati madhyama (588 cents) is also from fourths. These two form the basis for Melakarta raagas. Hence it will be interesting to investigate the patterns of srutis chosen for the melakarta raagas,  the patterns of fifths and fourths, considering that microtone variations are used in rendering raagas.
